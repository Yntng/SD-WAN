## ‚úÖ Notes

- Make sure the gateway IP is **within the same subnet** as the static IP assigned to the switch.
- This setup is necessary for **Layer 3 communication** and for the switch to route traffic outside its VLAN/subnet.
- If you're managing VLANs, ensure routing is configured properly for inter-VLAN communication.
